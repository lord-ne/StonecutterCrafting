A Minecraft mod to allow crafting Stonecutter recipes in a regular crafting table.
This can be useful for automation when it is not possible to automate the Stonecutter itself.

Currently for version 1.16.5.

## Usage

Craft some Stonecutter Nuggets from a Stoncutter. You can craft them back if you feel like it.

Craft a Reusable Stonecutter Template using a Stonecutter Nugget and two blocks (the two blocks are not consumed).
The top/left block should be a block that can be used as an input in the Stonecutter, and the bottom/right block should be a block that can be gotten as an output using the first block in the Stonecutter.
The resulting Template is "bound" to those input and output blocks.

You can use this Template to craft the input block into the output block. The Template is not consumed. 
You can put up to 8 of the input block in the Crafting Table with the Template to craft multiple at a time.

You can also craft the Reusable Stonecutter Template by itself to get a stack of Basic Stonecutter Templates (this does not consume the Reusable Template).
These work the same as the reusable ones, except they *are*  consumed when crafting.
